/**
 * Requirements:
 * 1) Write an application that creates two individual Die objects.  Both Die objects will be 6-sided.  
 * 2) Roll the two individual Die objects 100,000 times, counting the number of times a 7, 11, or double (both 
 * dice have the same face value) is rolled.
 * 3) Print the number of times each case was rolled (7, 11, or double)
 * 4) Print the percentage that a 7, 11, or double was rolled in 100,000 trials.  Use a DecimalFormat 
 * object to round the percentage to the nearest hundredth (“0.00”). Odds are usually between 38 – 40%.
